Service-side
============
√ Add `flight:quota` value to master via flight attendant
√ Add error messages (quota exceeded, no such queue, no such cluster etc.)
√ Solidify domain usage (i.e. replace `markt-dev`)
√ Solidify key specification (i.e. use env vars)
Deployment planning
Add ability to create 'custom' autoscaling groups? Maybe this better as server-side tweaks?
√ Add authentication/restriction to own clusters (`flight:identity` key? deal with via domain?)
√ Prevent race condition w/queues -- thread pool?

Cluster-side
============
Cluster-side CLI tool for adding/removing queues/nodes
√ Rework autoscaling to use tracon (both scale-up and scale-down)
Remove ability to perform autoscaling group modification from master node


Queries and mutation require an identity for the domain (root-only)
Mutation requires a key for the cluster (root-only)
